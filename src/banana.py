WHAT IS BANANA?
   Banana is a free and open-source SDK to write your portable Python apps.

   Banana currently supports JavaScript for the web, Android for mobile, and
   Mac, Windows, and GNU/Linux for desktop. i(Pad)OS is not yet supported.
   
   Banana is free to use under the BSD three-clause license.
   
   Most info printed by Banana is labeled with a banana emoji to distinguish
   them from regular info. If you cannot see the banana, ensure your
   computer can render Emoji in the console.

ETYMOLOGY
   Banana is named after a long curved fruit which grows in `clusters' and
   has soft pulpy flesh and yellow skin when developed to the point of
   readiness for harvesting and eating.
